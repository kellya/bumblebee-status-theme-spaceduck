# Bumblebee-Status Space duck theme

This is my work-in-progress theme for
[bumblebee-status](https://github.com/tobi-wan-kenobi/bumblebee-status/).  It is
based on the [Spaceduck](https://github.com/pineapplegiant/spaceduck) VIM theme.

## Installation
* Clone this repo (or just download the json files in the theme directory)
* Copy them to ~/.config/bumblebee-status/themes

## Variants
There are 2 theme variants:  spaceduck-powerline and spaceduck-dark-powerline.  The
spaceduck-powerline theme uses the background color for various status
representations while the foreground text is kept black.

The dark variant has dark backgrounds, and changes the foreground text color to represent status
changes.
